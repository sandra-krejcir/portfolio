                  <h1>The face behind Sandra Designs</h1>
                  <p>
                    Hi! As you already know, my name is Sandra Krejcir.
                    <br />Being a young Croatian girl who moved to Denmark only
                    a year ago, I faced a lot of challenges. However, thatâ€™s
                    exactly what pushed me to take risks, face my fears, and
                    work harder than ever to achieve everything I set my mind
                    on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am very devoted and ambitious, but not led by the means of
                    success or fortune. Moreover I strive to learn and gain
                    experience wherever/ whenever I can, in order to become the
                    best version of myself.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I would describe myself as a positive, open-minded and
                    inventive person who is always ready for teamwork. With that
                    being said, my eye for detail and perfectionism may
                    sometimes come in the way, but I belive in sharing/listening
                    to all perspectives and compromise (even if that means
                    putting my idea aside).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Currently, I'm still attending classes at KEA, in Multimedia
                    Design, and am now finishing the last projects of my
                    Frontend Elective before my internship.
                    <br />
                    Before starting my higher education at KEA, I've never
                    truely worked with any form of web design or coding, so all
                    of my displayed projects are school assignments through
                    which I have learned and continuously tried to improve my
                    newly acquired skills. Some of them of course better than
                    others, but all of them equally valuable repesenting my (if
                    I may say very quick) progress from a completely clueless
                    user to a confident frontend developer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even if most of the projects were "teacher generated", I do
                    have experience with client work. Aside from helping me
                    realize my full potential, working with different companies
                    improved my communication with my group members, with
                    possible future clients, as well as with self expression.
